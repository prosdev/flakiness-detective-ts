# Roadmap

This document outlines the future development plans for Flakiness Detective.

## Current Status (v0.1.0)

‚úÖ **Production-Ready with Advanced Capabilities**

This release represents a mature, battle-tested flakiness detection system with comprehensive features:

**Core Features**:

- ‚úÖ DBSCAN clustering with configurable distance metrics (cosine/euclidean)

- ‚úÖ **Multiple Distance Metrics**: Explicit support for cosine and euclidean distance
- ‚úÖ **Enhanced Metadata**: Captures failure IDs, run IDs, timestamps, and error messages
- ‚úÖ **Playwright Reporter Adapter**: Direct JSON report integration (no custom reporter needed)
- ‚úÖ **Comprehensive CLI**: Full command-line interface with detect/report commands
- ‚úÖ **Configuration File Support**: `.flakinessrc.json`, `.js`, `.ts`, and `package.json` with auto-discovery
- ‚úÖ **Input Validation**: Type-safe configuration and error handling
- ‚úÖ **Configurable Limits**: `maxClusters` option to control output size
- ‚úÖ **Full TypeScript Support**: Strict mode with complete type definitions
- ‚úÖ **Extensive Testing**: 93 passing tests with E2E coverage
- ‚úÖ **Comprehensive Documentation**: README files for all packages with examples and guides

## Planned Features

### üéØ High Priority

#### Custom Playwright Reporter

**Status**: Planned  
**Description**: Native Playwright reporter for real-time failure ingestion

- Direct integration without JSON report parsing
- Stream failures to Firestore during test execution
- Automatic metadata extraction (project, suite, run ID)
- Zero-configuration setup

**Use Case**: CI/CD pipelines that need immediate failure tracking

#### Web Dashboard

**Status**: Planned  
**Description**: Interactive visualization interface

- Cluster timeline views
- Failure trend analysis
- Interactive pattern exploration
- Exportable reports
- Real-time updates (with WebSocket support)

**Technology**: React + TypeScript, D3.js or Recharts

#### Enhanced Pattern Detection

**Status**: Planned  
**Description**: More sophisticated pattern analysis

- Temporal pattern detection (time-of-day, day-of-week)
- Cross-test correlation analysis
- Failure cascade detection (one failure causing others)
- Severity scoring based on impact

### üîß Medium Priority

#### Debug Mode

**Status**: Planned  
**Description**: Enhanced debugging capabilities

- `--debug` flag for verbose output
- API usage monitoring
- Execution time tracking
- Cluster quality metrics
- Step-by-step pipeline visualization

**Usage**:

```bash
flakiness-detective detect --debug --output-path debug-results.json
```

#### Additional Test Frameworks

**Status**: Planned  
**Description**: Expand beyond Playwright

- Jest adapter
- Cypress adapter
- Mocha/Chai adapter
- Generic test result format

**Challenge**: Each framework has different error formats and metadata

#### Alerting System

**Status**: Planned  
**Description**: Notification system for new patterns

- Slack integration
- Email notifications
- GitHub issue creation
- Discord webhooks
- Custom webhook support

**Configuration**:

```typescript
{
  alerts: {
    channels: ['slack', 'email'],
    threshold: { newClusters: 1, clusterGrowth: 50 },
    recipients: ['team@company.com'],
  }
}
```

#### Historical Trend Analysis

**Status**: Planned  
**Description**: Track pattern evolution over time

- Cluster stability metrics
- Flakiness rate trends
- Resolution tracking
- Pattern lifecycle (new, growing, stable, resolved)

#### Smart Failure Grouping

**Status**: Planned  
**Description**: Advanced clustering techniques

- Hierarchical clustering for multi-level patterns
- Auto-tuning epsilon based on dataset
- Ensemble clustering methods
- Outlier detection for unique failures

### üåü Future Enhancements

#### AI-Powered Root Cause Suggestions

**Status**: Exploring  
**Description**: Use LLMs to suggest potential root causes

- Analyze failure patterns with GPT-4/Claude
- Cross-reference with code changes
- Suggest debugging steps
- Link to similar resolved issues

**Challenges**:

- Cost of LLM API calls
- Quality and reliability of suggestions
- Context window limitations

#### GitHub Actions Integration

**Status**: Planned  
**Description**: Pre-built GitHub Action for easy setup

```yaml
- uses: flakiness-detective/detect@v1
  with:
    report-path: ./test-results
    api-key: ${{ secrets.GOOGLE_AI_KEY }}
    adapter: firestore
```

#### Cloud Service

**Status**: Long-term  
**Description**: Hosted version with managed infrastructure

- No setup required
- Scalable storage and processing
- Team collaboration features
- API access for custom integrations

**Considerations**: Pricing model, data privacy, infrastructure costs

#### Browser Extension

**Status**: Exploring  
**Description**: View flakiness data in CI/CD UI

- Inline annotations on GitHub Actions
- Quick access to cluster details
- Historical failure views
- One-click pattern exploration

#### Test Stabilization Recommendations

**Status**: Exploring  
**Description**: Automated suggestions for fixing flaky tests

- Detect common anti-patterns (timing issues, race conditions)
- Suggest wait strategies and stability improvements
- Code examples for fixes
- Integration with PR comments

### üìö Documentation & Community

#### Enhanced Documentation

**Status**: Ongoing

- Video tutorials
- Case studies and success stories
- Best practices guide
- Architecture deep-dives
- Performance tuning guide

#### Example Projects

**Status**: Planned

- Sample Playwright project with flakiness detection
- CI/CD integration examples (GitHub Actions, GitLab CI, CircleCI)
- Firestore setup guide
- Dashboard deployment examples

#### Community Building

**Status**: Ongoing

- Active GitHub Discussions
- Regular release notes
- Community contributions welcome
- Code of conduct
- Contributor recognition
